Range of any datatype can be considered as Cyclic Property. 
let us suppose we have data-structure of n-bit : -
- <font color="#00b0f0">With n-bits : :</font> total 2<sup>n</sup> values we can represent  
- <font color="#00b0f0">For unsigned : :</font> Range = 0 --- to --- 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
- <font color="#00b0f0">For signed : :</font> Range = -2<sup>n-1</sup> --- to --- 2<sup>n-1</sup> -1

This is the Example for char datatype : -
- `sign char` - 1Bytes = 8bit
- `unsigned char` - 1Bytes = 8bit
- <font color="#00b0f0">Range Unsigned char</font> = 0----to---2<sup>8</sup>-1 === (0-----255)
- <font color="#00b0f0">Range Signed char</font> = -2<sup>8-1</sup>---to---2<sup>8-1</sup>-1 === (-128---to---127)

Similarly we can make it for Unsigned char its easy to understand 😁
